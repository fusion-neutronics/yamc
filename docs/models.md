# Models and simulating

## Model

### Creating a Model

The ``Model`` brings together geometry, sources, tallies, and simulation settings.

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
model = yamc.Model(
    geometry=geometry,
    tallies=[tally1, tally2],
    source=source,
)
results = model.simulate_transport(total_particles=100000, seed=42)
```

The particle count and random seed are per-run arguments to ``simulate_transport`` (and ``simulate_transmutation``), not ``Model`` constructor kwargs. Both default to ``total_particles=1000`` and ``seed=1``, so one model can be re-run at different counts/seeds without rebuilding it.

Both CSG ``Geometry`` and ``MeshGeometry`` are accepted.

### Photon transport

Enable coupled neutron-photon transport with ``transport_secondary_photons=True``. Materials must have photon data loaded (see [Loading nuclear data](materials.md#loading-nuclear-data)).

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
model = yamc.Model(
    geometry=geometry,
    source=source,
    transport_secondary_photons=True,
    photon_cutoff_energy=1000.0,     # eV (default)
    electron_treatment="ttb",         # thick-target bremsstrahlung (default); or "local"
)
```

For D1S shutdown dose rate calculations, enable decay photon production:

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
model = yamc.Model(
    ...,
    transport_secondary_photons=True,
    use_decay_photons=True,
)
```

### Simulation knobs

Less-frequently-tuned ``Model`` constructor kwargs. Defaults are usually fine; reach for these when the simulation aborts or you're benchmarking the GPU path.

- ``free_gas_threshold`` (default ``400.0``) -- the threshold, in multiples of ``k_B·T``, above which elastic scattering treats the target nuclide as a stationary scatterer rather than sampling its thermal velocity from the free-gas Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The default of 400 kT is the standard convention; lowering it widens the energy range where thermal motion of the target is sampled (slightly slower, marginally more physical at low energies); raising it skips the sampling earlier (slightly faster, slightly less accurate near the threshold).
- ``max_lost_particles`` (default ``10``) -- abort ``simulate_transport`` after this many particles have been lost (no valid cell found at a step). A lost particle indicates a geometry problem (overlapping cells, an uncovered region, a numerical-precision edge case); aborting early avoids running a long simulation against a broken model. See [Lost particles and geometry debugging](simulate_transport.md#lost-particles-and-geometry-debugging) for diagnosing them.
- ``gpu_max_steps_per_particle`` (default ``100000``) -- hard cap on transport steps per particle on the **GPU** path. Ignored by CPU transport, which terminates particles naturally via absorption, leakage, and the lost-particle diagnostics; the GPU kernel has no concept of "lost" and needs an explicit cap to bound shader runtime. Setting it and then running on the CPU emits a warning, since the request has no effect there. The default is deliberately high so the GPU matches the CPU on strong scatterers (a ``1000`` cap cost ~10% of the integral flux on a pure-H2 sphere). A cap that binds is an error: if any history in a GPU launch is still transporting at the cap, ``simulate_transport`` raises ``ValueError`` naming the cap rather than returning under-counted tallies, so raise it for a deep-penetration GPU run, or run on the CPU. Lower it only to bound worst-case kernel time on a pathological geometry you expect to leak or absorb well within it.
- ``gpu_fission_bank`` (default ``True``) -- whether the GPU banks fission progeny on the device. Inert without fissile material and on the CPU. Turn it off to run a fissile model with a mesh tally on the GPU, which the dispatch otherwise refuses: the combination of per-source accumulation across fission generations and direct mesh scoring is not wired up. The cost is that fission progeny are not banked on the device, so the run takes the non-fissile loop, which is what makes the mesh path work.

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
model = yamc.Model(
    geometry=geometry,
    source=source,
    free_gas_threshold=400.0,        # default
    max_lost_particles=10,           # default
    gpu_max_steps_per_particle=100000,   # default; GPU path only
    gpu_fission_bank=True,           # default; GPU path only
)

model.gpu_fission_bank = False       # also settable after construction
```

### Tracking mode (Woodcock / delta tracking)

``tracking_mode`` selects the particle-transport algorithm. ``"surface"`` (default) is standard ray-tracing -- at each step compute the distance to the nearest cell boundary, advance the particle, sample a collision against the current material's ``Σ_t``. Delta tracking instead samples a free flight against a *global majorant* ``Σ_maj`` (the per-energy max of ``Σ_t`` across every material in the model), moves the particle the full sampled distance ignoring cell boundaries, and runs a rejection loop at the sampled point that decides whether the event is real (``Σ_t / Σ_maj``) or virtual (no physics, continue). Skipping the per-step ``closest_boundary`` is the algorithmic gain.

There are two delta-tracking modes. **For nearly all models you want ``"hybrid"``**:

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
model = yamc.Model(
    geometry=geometry,
    source=source,
    tracking_mode="hybrid",   # delta tracking, safe in voids
)
```

When to use which:

- ``"surface"`` -- default; always safe. A good general choice, and the fastest option for typical cell-sparse geometries (few cells per mean free path), where delta tracking's boundary-skipping has little to skip.
- ``"hybrid"`` -- **the recommended Woodcock mode.** Delta tracking with an automatic per-cell fallback to surface tracking in cells where it would be inefficient (voids, large low-density regions like a vacuum vessel or air). It keeps the boundary-skipping win in dense regions and is *never* pathological in voids, so it is the safe way to get delta tracking's speed on a realistic fusion model. Use this whenever your geometry contains any void or low-density region.
- ``"woodcock"`` -- *pure* delta tracking, no fallback. **Only for geometrically dense, void-free models** (many cells per mean free path with similar ``Σ_t``, e.g. a finely diced or CAD-tessellated geometry). On such models it can be several times faster than surface tracking. **Do not use it on a model with large voids:** ``Σ_maj`` then far exceeds the local ``Σ_t``, the rejection loop churns virtual collisions, and it becomes much slower than ``"surface"`` (that is exactly the case ``"hybrid"`` fixes). When in doubt, use ``"hybrid"``.

All three give the same answer within statistics; they differ only in speed.

### Survival biasing (implicit capture)

``variance_reduction`` takes a list of technique objects; an empty list (the default) is fully analog transport. Techniques compose in the same list (currently survival biasing, below, and [weight windows](weight_windows.md)), and the list order carries no meaning.

``yamc.SurvivalBiasing`` enables the first technique, implicit capture: instead of killing the particle when absorption is sampled (analog capture), every collision multiplies the particle weight by the scattering probability ``Σ_s / Σ_t`` and the particle always scatters. Histories are never cut short by capture, so they keep contributing track length to deep tallies. Low-weight particles are culled fairly by weight-cutoff Russian roulette: below ``weight_cutoff`` a particle survives with probability ``weight / weight_survive`` (continuing at ``weight_survive``) or is killed, which conserves weight in expectation. Matches the standard ``survival_biasing`` setting and defaults.

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
model = yamc.Model(
    geometry=geometry,
    source=source,
    variance_reduction=[
        yamc.SurvivalBiasing(
            weight_cutoff=0.25,    # default; roulette trigger
            weight_survive=1.0,    # default; weight of roulette survivors
        ),
    ],
)
```

Notes:

- Works in all three tracking modes; the means are unchanged within statistics, only the variance (and history length) differ.
- **Judge the benefit by the per-tally FOM printed at the end of the run, not by the particles/s line.** Histories no longer terminate at capture, so raw throughput often *drops* (in strongly absorbing media roulette can instead shorten histories and raise it), while the error bars shrink faster than the throughput changes. On absorption-dominated problems a roughly 2x FOM gain is typical: the same error bars in about half the CPU time.
- Most effective on absorption-dominated problems and deep tallies; for leakage-dominated problems it changes little.
- At most one ``SurvivalBiasing`` entry is allowed in the list (duplicates are rejected). ``model.variance_reduction`` returns copies: configure technique objects and assign a whole list rather than mutating entries in place.
- Composes with everything weight-aware: tallies, secondary-photon production, D1S decay photons, and transmutation reaction rates all score with the particle weight (photons inherit the parent neutron's pre-discount weight). ``compute='gpu'`` refuses ``variance_reduction`` (the kernel runs analog transport) rather than silently ignoring it.

### Weight windows

The second variance-reduction technique, weight windows (mesh-based splitting and roulette), targets deep-penetration and streaming tallies that survival biasing alone cannot reach. It has its own generation workflow, so it is documented on a dedicated page: see [Weight windows](weight_windows.md).

### Saving and loading results

A ``SimulationResults`` object can be written to a single Arrow file and read back in any later session. The full per-bin statistics (mean, variance, history counts) and run provenance are preserved, so a loaded result behaves exactly like a fresh one -- for plotting, inspection, or [combining](#combining-results-from-separate-runs).

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
results = model.simulate_transport(total_particles=10000)
results.to_arrow("run1.arrow")                            # save

# Later, or in another session / on another machine:
loaded = yamc.SimulationResults.from_arrow("run1.arrow")  # load
print(loaded["flux"].mean, loaded["flux"].relative_error)
```

### Combining results from separate runs

``yamc.combine_results`` pools the results of independent runs of the same model into one result that is *statistically identical to a single longer run*: it merges the raw per-bin Welford state (mean, M2, history count) of every tally, the same exact operation the transport loop uses to combine per-thread partials. Means, error bars and figures of merit come out as if all histories had been one simulation (FOM uses the summed wall-clock time).

The one rule: **every run needs its own seed.** yamc derives per-particle random streams from the base seed, so two runs with the same seed re-trace the same histories; ``combine_results`` refuses them with an error rather than silently producing wrong error bars.

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
# Two runs of the same model -- each needs its own seed; particle counts can
# differ. Here a 100k run and a 200k run.
model_a = yamc.Model(geometry=geometry, source=source, tallies=tallies)
model_b = yamc.Model(geometry=geometry, source=source, tallies=tallies)

results_a = model_a.simulate_transport(total_particles=100_000, seed=1)
results_b = model_b.simulate_transport(total_particles=200_000, seed=2)

combined = yamc.combine_results(results_a, results_b)   # pooled -- as if 300k histories
print(combined["flux"].relative_error)

# Works across sessions too: save each run with results.to_arrow(...) (see
# "Saving and loading results" above) and combine the Arrow files later.
r1 = yamc.SimulationResults.from_arrow("run1.arrow")
r2 = yamc.SimulationResults.from_arrow("run2.arrow")
combined = yamc.combine_results(r1, r2)
```

This also gives a simple cluster pattern with no MPI required: launch N jobs with seeds 1..N, save each with ``results.to_arrow(...)``, and combine the files afterwards -- statistically exact.

What is validated before combining (all hard errors, never silent):

- distinct seeds across all contributing runs;
- same model: geometry, materials, source, physics settings and per-nuclide nuclear-data libraries (a library mismatch is reported per nuclide, e.g. ``n:Co58: "endf-b8.1" vs "fendl-3.2d"``);
- same-name tallies must have identical configurations;
- GPU-produced results are refused (the GPU path does not record the exact merge state).

Tallies present in only some runs are carried through unchanged with a ``UserWarning`` -- their statistics come from the runs that scored them, and their FOM uses those runs' time only. ``results.runs`` lists the provenance (seed, history count, elapsed time, fingerprint, data libraries) of every contributing run.


### Plotting

``model.plot()`` renders the geometry with source points overlaid.

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
plot = model.plot(
    basis="xz",
    color_by="material",
    outline="cell",
    resolution=400000,
    n_samples=1000,  # number of source points to overlay
)
plot.save("model.html")
plot.save("model.png")
```

And rendered live (the dots are sampled source points):

```python exec="1" html="1"
import html
import yamc

steel = yamc.Material(composition={"Fe": 1.0}, density=7.874, name="steel")
water = yamc.Material(composition={"H2O": 1.0}, density=1.0, name="water")
inner, outer = yamc.Cylinder(axis="z", radius=2.0), yamc.Cylinder(axis="z", radius=8.0)
bottom, top = yamc.Plane(axis="z", offset=-12.0), yamc.Plane(axis="z", offset=12.0)
box = (
    yamc.Plane(axis="x", offset=-15.0, boundary="vacuum").above
    & yamc.Plane(axis="x", offset=15.0, boundary="vacuum").below
    & yamc.Plane(axis="y", offset=-15.0, boundary="vacuum").above
    & yamc.Plane(axis="y", offset=15.0, boundary="vacuum").below
    & yamc.Plane(axis="z", offset=-15.0, boundary="vacuum").above
    & yamc.Plane(axis="z", offset=15.0, boundary="vacuum").below
)
pipe = yamc.Cell(region=inner.above & outer.below & bottom.above & top.below, material=steel, name="pipe")
coolant = yamc.Cell(region=inner.below & bottom.above & top.below, material=water, name="coolant")
void = yamc.Cell(region=box & ~(outer.below & bottom.above & top.below), name="void")
geometry = yamc.Geometry([pipe, coolant, void])
source = yamc.NeutronSource(energy=14.06e6, position=(0, 0, 0))
model = yamc.Model(geometry=geometry, source=source)

doc = model.plot(basis="xz", color_by="material", outline="cell", n_samples=400)._repr_html_()
print(f'<iframe srcdoc="{html.escape(doc, quote=True)}" width="100%" height="520" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:4px"></iframe>')
```


For manual matplotlib plotting:

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
slice_data = model.sample_slice(basis="xy", resolution=(400, 400))
```

### VTK-HDF model export

``model.to_vtkhdf`` writes the geometry and the sampled source together (as a VTK-HDF partitioned collection), so a single file shows both in [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/).

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
model.to_vtkhdf("model.vtkhdf", resolution=10000, samples=1000)  # geometry + source
model.to_vtkhdf("source.vtkhdf", include=["source"], samples=1000)
```

The viewer below is rendered live when these docs are built: it writes ``model.vtkhdf``, reads it back, and shows the voxelized geometry (cut in half, coloured by material) together with the sampled source points (drag to rotate, scroll to zoom).

```python exec="1" html="1"
import html

import pyvista as pv
from vtkmodules.vtkIOHDF import vtkHDFReader

steel = yamc.Material(composition={"Fe": 1.0}, density=7.874, name="steel")
water = yamc.Material(composition={"H2O": 1.0}, density=1.0, name="water")

)
pipe = yamc.Cell(region=inner.above & outer.below & bottom.above & top.below, material=steel, name="pipe")
coolant = yamc.Cell(region=inner.below & bottom.above & top.below, material=water, name="coolant")
void = yamc.Cell(region=box & ~(outer.below & bottom.above & top.below), name="void")
geometry = yamc.Geometry([pipe, coolant, void])
# Same point source at the origin as the model.plot viewer above.
source = yamc.NeutronSource(energy=14.06e6, position=(0, 0, 0))
model = yamc.Model(geometry=geometry, source=source)
model.to_vtkhdf("model.vtkhdf", resolution=300000, samples=2000)


def leaves(collection):
    out = []
    for i in range(collection.GetNumberOfPartitionedDataSets()):
        pds = collection.GetPartitionedDataSet(i)
        for j in range(pds.GetNumberOfPartitions()):
            part = pds.GetPartition(j)
            if part is not None:
                out.append(pv.wrap(part))
    return out


reader = vtkHDFReader()
reader.SetFileName("model.vtkhdf")
reader.Update()
geom = next(d for d in leaves(reader.GetOutput()) if "material_id" in d.cell_data)
pts = next(d for d in leaves(reader.GetOutput()) if d.n_points and "energy" in d.point_data)

plotter = pv.Plotter(window_size=(760, 560))
plotter.add_mesh(geom.threshold(-0.5, scalars="material_id").clip(normal="x"),
                 scalars="material_id", cmap="Set2", show_scalar_bar=False, opacity=0.85)
plotter.add_mesh(pts, color="orange", render_points_as_spheres=True, point_size=5)
plotter.add_axes()
plotter.camera_position = "iso"

doc = plotter.export_html(filename=None).read()
print(
    f'<iframe srcdoc="{html.escape(doc, quote=True)}" width="100%" height="580" '
    'style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:4px"></iframe>'
)
```

### Save and load (JSON)

A model can be serialised to and from JSON. The JSON captures the **specification** -- geometry, materials, source, tallies, run parameters. Nuclide cross-section data is **not** included, so a loaded model still needs to load nuclear data before ``simulate_transport`` (the same way a model built from scratch does).

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
# Write a pretty-printed JSON file (git-diff-friendly).
model.save("blanket_v3.json")

# Round-trip from disk.
model = yamc.Model.load("blanket_v3.json")

# Or work with JSON strings directly.
spec = model.to_json(pretty=True)
model2 = yamc.Model.load(spec)        # load() accepts a string too
```

Typical uses:

- Check models into git so reviewers can ``diff`` the spec without running anything.
- Build a model in a notebook, serialise it, and re-load it in a HPC job script -- the particle count and seed are no longer part of the saved model, so just pass a different ``total_particles`` or ``seed`` to ``simulate_transport`` when you run it there.
- Ship a model spec alongside a publication.

### Export to a runnable HTML page (``to_html``)

``model.to_html(path)`` writes a fully self-contained HTML file that opens in any browser and runs the simulation inside the page (WASM build of the transport engine). Useful for: sharing a working example with someone who doesn't have Python or yamc installed; embedding a runnable demo in a paper or course; locking down a model for educational use.

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
# Minimal: writes geometry / source / tallies; XS data fetched at
# runtime from yamc-data.xsplot.com (requires network), one temperature
# per nuclide: the byte ranges of the batches each material's
# temperature needs, not the whole file.
model.to_html("demo.html")

# Fully offline: embed every nuclide the current materials use.
# Recipient gets a portable file that runs with no network.
model.to_html("portable.html", embed_cross_sections=True)

# Embed a *family* of nuclides to anticipate the recipient swapping
# Li6 for Li7 without breaking the offline behaviour.
model.to_html("portable.html", embed_cross_sections=["Li"])

# Lock-down for teaching -- recipient can re-simulate but cannot edit
# geometry or tally definitions.
model.to_html(
    "locked.html",
    show_surfaces=False,
    show_materials=True,    # let students change density / composition
    show_tallies=False,
)

# Bake in a static snapshot of an interactive mesh-tally plot so the
# recipient sees the spatial distribution on first load.
plot = tally.plot(geometry=geometry, basis="xz")
model.to_html(
    "with_flux_map.html",
    embed_cross_sections=True,
    tally_plot_html=plot._repr_html_(),
)
```

Embedded XS data inflates the HTML size by roughly the raw byte count × 1.33 (base64), and embeds every temperature. ENDF/B-VIII.1 nuclides range from ~1.2 MB (Li6) to ~56 MB (Fe56) whole, so embedding everything in a heavy-element material can produce a multi-hundred-MB HTML; pick ``embed_cross_sections`` accordingly. The fetch-at-runtime path is lighter: it brings one temperature of each nuclide's reactions and energy grids (about 22 MB for Fe56 rather than 56), because the published data is written one Arrow batch per (MT, temperature) with a byte-range index in each nuclide's ``version.json``.

The ``show_*`` flags are presentation-only -- the recipient can still inspect (or open devtools and edit) the embedded model JSON. Use them to declutter the UI, not as a security boundary.
