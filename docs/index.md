# YAMC

YAMC (Yet Another Monte Carlo) is an open-source Monte Carlo particle transport code for
neutron and photon simulations, aimed at fusion neutronics workflows.

It supports constructive solid and mesh-based geometries, coupled neutron-photon transport,
transmutation, shutdown dose rate analysis, CAD geometry import, flexible tallies, and
convenient post-processing, all accessible through a Python API.

YAMC's priorities are:

- First-class support for fusion neutronics workflows
- Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, on x86 and ARM CPUs and AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel GPUs, and in the browser via WebAssembly
- Straightforward installation with `pip`, no compilation step
- A fully permissively licensed open-source dependency stack
- Batteries included: CAD geometry meshing, transmutation, convenient cross section data downloading, and visualization built in

What each of those means in practice is on [Why YAMC](why_yamc.md).
